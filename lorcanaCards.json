When you play Let the Storm Rage On, if there's a character in play you can choose to deal 2 damage to, you must do so. Even if Let the Storm Rage on banishes your Ursula - Deceiver of All, you can still use her What a Deal ability. In this case you won't be able to deal 2 damage to a character, as there aren't any in play, but you still draw a card.",

The card played a second time with Ursula - Deceiver of All's ability What a Deal is placed on the bottom of your deck after its effect has finished."

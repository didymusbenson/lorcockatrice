### Update 5/30/24
Added additional metadata to cards for better searchability. 

# lorcockatrice
Watch this space for updates. I've written a very barebones script that can rip Lorcana card data and repackage it into the Cockatrice VTT's custom deck formatting. I will be adding the initial XML file immediately and in the next little while after I'm able to clean up the code a little bit I'll throw the script up here too. For now, if you import this collection into Cockatrice, you'll have the decks and card images ready to go to play a game of Lorcana.


To install the custom deck:
* Download "allSets.xml"
* Open cockatrice
* Under "Card Database" select "Add custom sets/cards"
* Choose allSets.xml

Your Lorcana sets will be added to the card database. Remember to enable/disable whatever sets you don't want to see in your Card Database options. 

Up next: Cockatrice is very MTG focused, but there _are_ many custom fields in the card database that work effectively for building out a Lorcana database. I intend to start exporting _actual_ sets with more accurate data in the coming weeks and getting my scripts updated here, for you, for free.

### Update 3/17/25
Life has gotten in the way and as you can probably tell I'm behind by several sets. I had goals with Lorcana tools that ultimately I'm not going to end up pursue. I have added my source scripts, anyone who can read code should be able to pretty quickly understand how this works and pull new sets. You can get an up to date source JSON from https://lorcanajson.org/

### Update 5/30/24
Added additional metadata to cards for better searchability.

Watch this space for updates. I've written a very barebones script that can rip Lorcana card data and repackage it into the Cockatrice VTT's custom deck formatting. I will be adding the initial XML file immediately and in the next little while after I'm able to clean up the code a little bit I'll throw the script up here too. For now, if you import this collection into Cockatrice, you'll have the decks and card images ready to go to play a game of Lorcana.

To install the custom deck:
* Download "allSets.xml"
* Open cockatrice
* Under "Card Database" select "Add custom sets/cards"
* Choose allSets.xml

Your Lorcana sets will be added to the card database. Remember to enable/disable whatever sets you don't want to see in your Card Database options. 

Up next: Cockatrice is very MTG focused, but there _are_ many custom fields in the card database that work effectively for building out a Lorcana database. I intend to start exporting _actual_ sets with more accurate data in the coming weeks and getting my scripts updated here, for you, for free.

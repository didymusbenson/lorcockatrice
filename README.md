# lorcockatrice
Watch this space for updates. I've written a very barebones script that can rip Lorcana card data and repackage it into the Cockatrice VTT's custom deck formatting. I will be adding the initial XML file immediately and in the next little while after I'm able to clean up the code a little bit I'll throw the script up here too. For now, if you import this collection into Cockatrice, you'll have the decks and card images ready to go to play a game of Lorcana.
